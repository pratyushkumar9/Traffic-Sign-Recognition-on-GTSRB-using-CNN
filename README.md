# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-on-GTSRB-using-CNN

GTSRB Dataset was used in the proposed model in which it includes 43 classes and more than 50000 images. Github doesnt allow to upload Dataset due size issues. So to use the model one should apply the model over whatever file of dataset should be used, for example in this proposed model, I have used pickel file where, I converted the images train folder into pickel file then used in the model.

I have uploaded 2 files and in one it uses Edge detection technique and one doesnt uses it.
